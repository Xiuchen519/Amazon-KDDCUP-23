# Data Preprocessing Scripts

The folder is used to save the preprocessing scripts, like `.py` or `.ipynb`. Here we
could see more statistics about the raw data and filtering some information for a smaller dataset. For example, we could first obtain a small dataset with only ID and timestamps.

Please ensure each file in the folder could be ran directly.
